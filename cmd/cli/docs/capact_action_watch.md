## capact action watch

Watch an Action until it has completed execution

### Synopsis


    Watch an Action until it has completed execution

    NOTE:   An action needs to be created and run in order to run this command.
            This command calls the Kubernetes API directly. As a result, KUBECONFIG has to be configured
            with the same cluster as the one which the Gateway points to.
