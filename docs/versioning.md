## Overview

The versioning for OCF and OCH are similar in concept to how Kubernetes implements versioning. Below is a table comparing Capact versioning to Kubernetes versioning.

| Capact                          | Kubernetes                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| OCH Version                      | Kubernetes Version        |
| OCF Version                      | Resource **apiVersion**   |
| Manifests **revision**           | **resourceVersion**       |
| TypeInstance **resourceVersion** | **resourceVersion**       |
| Engine                           | `kube-controller-manager` |
| CLI                              | `kubectl`                 |
| Go SDK                           | `client-go`               |

The following diagram shows the versioning concept:

## OCF Version

This is the version of the Open Capability Format itself. The version changes every time there is a change in any of OCF entity manifest, such as adding or removing properties in a manifest or introducing a brand-new entity.

### Supporting multiple OCF versions in OCH

> **NOTE** This section describes our long-term goal. Currently, the feature is not implemented.

OCH supports multiple versions of OCF. To achieve that, we reuse the API versioning concept from Kubernetes. A single OCF version is used to store resources in the database. However, OCH does the conversion between the stored resource and one of the supported OCF versions by OCH on-the-fly.

The cluster administrator migrates the storage version of the resource manually during OCH upgrade/downgrade. In the future, we will introduce automatic migration between storage versions or external tools that facilitates the process.

**Example:**

OCH 0.3.0 can support OCF versions 0.2.0 and 0.1.0. The RepoMetadata entity is defined as follows:

```yaml
kind: RepoMetadata
# (...)
spec:
   ochVersion: 0.1.0
   ocfVersion:
       default: 0.2.0
       supported:
           - 0.1.0
           - 0.2.0
# (...)
```

The manifest version stored in OCH is 0.2.0. However, using a different API endpoint, the user can fetch manifests in version 0.1.0. OCH supports on-the-fly conversion between the default (stored) OCF manifests to the OCF manifests in supported versions.

### Deprecation policy of OCF versions

The deprecation policy is very similar to the [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/). The only change is that we will use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning OCF. There are multiple reasons to use SemVer 2 for OCF versioning:

- Unification of versioning across all Project Capact components.
- Clear way to represent new features without breaking changes. You can easily see that there is a new OCF feature that you can use. In Kubernetes API versioning, a new non-breaking feature doesn’t change the version, e.g. `v1`.
- Unification with other projects in the open source community, such as OAM, CNAB, CloudEvents, AsyncAPI.

Once we deprecate an OCF version, we will include deprecation notices in OCH release notes. We will warn users every time they access deprecated OCF:

- in CLI,
- on UI,
- through the GraphQL API (using [Warning header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Warning)).

A deprecated OCF version will have a transition period (see [Kubernetes deprecation policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/) for details) where it’s still supported by OCH. After that period, we remove support for the deprecated OCF version from the OCH release.

OCH rejects any submission of OCF manifests in unsupported versions.

The OCF storage version in OCH is never the deprecated one. This way, there won’t be a case when existing manifests are removed during OCH upgrade due to an unsupported version.

## Manifests revision

Unlike Kubernetes **resourceVersion**, we store all previous revisions of manifests such Type, Implementation, Interface and Attribute. Users can consume them anytime. Manifests can refer to older revisions of the other manifests.

**Example:** Implementation implements specific Interface revision. Revision of the Interface is increased once input or output Type changes. Content Creator updates the revision manually.

## TypeInstance **resourceVersion**

This is the version of TypeInstance **metadata** and **spec** fields. Unlike Kubernetes, we store historical data for audits and rollback purposes.

## Core manifests

We version core manifests (manifests, which are located under [`core` subdirectory](../och-content/core)) in the same way as the OCF itself. Core entities are strictly tied into the OCH release, and they are read-only.

## Application version

> **NOTE:** The following subsection describes future application version features, which are not yet implemented.

The Implementation manifest contains the **appVersion** field, which defines the supported version of the actual application. The **appVersion** field is independent from the revision.

The appVersion is a string in the following format:

```yaml
appVersion: "1.0.x, 1.1.0 - 1.3.0" # String with allowed version ranges
```

It is inspired by the [CNAB dependency version object](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec/blob/master/500-CNAB-dependencies.md). If the **appVersion** ranges are in SemVer 2 format, you can use ranges using dashes. If the **appVersion** ranges are not in SemVer 2, then you have to specify every supported appVersion in the string.

### Default application versions in SemVer format

During the submission of the Implementation manifest, if the **appVersion** field is defined in the SemVer format, OCH updates the following versions:

- `latest` — depending on the OCH configuration, it points to stable or edge version
- `stable` — points to the Implementation with highest semVer version in range without
  suffix [starting from the hyphen](https://semver.org/#spec-item-9)
  
  For example, if the range is defined as `1.0.x - 1.1.0-beta1`, the 1.0.9 is picked as an **appVersion**.
  
- `edge` — points to the Implementation with highest semVer version in range, even if it contains suffix starting from the hyphen
  
  For example, if the range is defined as `1.0.x - 1.1.0-beta1`, the 1.1.0-beta1 is picked as an **appVersion**.

You can use the versions in Implementation manifest to filter prerequisite Implementations based on the **appVersion** value. For example, if your Implementation depends on the latest stable PostgreSQL version, then you can use the `stable` version as the application version of PostgreSQL.

### Default application versions in different format than SemVer

If the application is not versioned using SemVer format, we assume that all possible **appVersion** values are sorted from oldest to newest. This way, the `latest` version is always the newest **appVersion** value.

**Example:**

In the following example, the `baz` version is picked as the latest one.

```yaml
ocfVersion: 0.0.1
revision: 1.0.0
metadata:
  prefix: cap.implementation.database.mysql
  name: install
spec:
   appVersion: "foo, bar, baz"
```

### Conflict prevention

An application version can be defined as a range. During Implementation manifest submission, the OCH validates whether the application version range doesn't overlap with the same revision of the Implementation manifest. As noted earlier, the manifest **revision** property is independent from the **appVersion**.

**Example:**

1. The following implementation manifest already exists in the OCH:

```yaml
ocfVersion: 0.0.1
kind: Implementation
metadata:
  prefix: cap.implementation.database.mysql
  name: install
revision: 1.0.0
spec:
  appVersion: "8.0.0-8.0.20"
```

2. When you try to submit the following manifest to the OCH...

```yaml
ocfVersion: 0.0.1
metadata:
  prefix: cap.implementation.database.mysql
  name: install
revision: 1.0.1
spec:
  appVersion: "8.0.x"
```

3. ...the operation fails as the **appVersion** property range overlaps with existing `cap.implementation.database.mysql.install` Implementation manifest.

## Engine and CLI versions

Engine and CLI versions need to be compatible with OCH, as they consume content from OCH. This is similar case as the `kubectl` is compatible with the Kubernetes APIServer.
