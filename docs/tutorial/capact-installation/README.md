# Capact installation

There are the following ways to install Capact on production-ready cluster:

- [AWS EKS installation](./aws-eks.md)
- [GCP GKE installation](./gcp-gke.md)

For development purposes, you can install Capact locally. To learn how to do that, see the [Development cluster](../../development.md#development-cluster) section in `development.md` document.
