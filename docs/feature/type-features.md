## Additional references to parent nodes

> **NOTE** This feature is currently not implemented.
> In the future, this feature will be also available for Attribute.

Type can contain additional references to other parent nodes. The connection means that the Type becomes a child of the referenced parent nodes. In a result, the Type has multiple parents.

![Additional references to parent nodes](./assets/type-additional-refs.svg)

Currently, the feature brings the following benefits:
- **GraphQL API:** it allows User to find related Types based on a prefix of the parent node.
- **Implementation manifest:** the **requires** property in Implementation manifest can refer to Types, which has additional references to parent node

### Find Types based on prefix of parent nodes

> **NOTE** This feature is currently not implemented.

1. `cap.type.platform.cloud-foundry` references `cap.core.type.platform` empty node:

   ```yaml
   # Type manifest
   kind: Type
   metadata:
      name: cloud-foundry
      # (...)
   spec:
      additionalRefs:
         - cap.core.type.platform
   # (...)
   ```

1. User queries OCH for all Types with prefix `cap.core.type.platform.*`.
1. OCH returns the following Types:

   ```yaml
   - name: "cap.core.type.platform.kubernetes"
   - name: "cap.type.platform.cloud-foundry"
   ```

### Requirements section in Implementation manifest

> **NOTE** This feature is currently not implemented.

Type `cap.type.platform.cloud-foundry` can specify additional reference to `cap.core.type.platform` empty node.

```yaml
# Type manifest
kind: Type
metadata:
   name: cloud-foundry
   # (...)
spec:
   additionalRefs:
      - cap.core.type.platform
# (...)
```

In that way, the Type `cap.type.platform.cloud-foundry` can be used in the context of any Type with prefix `cap.type.platform.*`, such as **requires** property:

```yaml
# Implementation manifest
# (...)
spec:
   # (...)
   requires:
    cap.core.type.platform:
      oneOf:
        - name: kubernetes
          revision: 0.1.0
        - name: cap.type.platform.cloud-foundry
          revision: 0.1.1
```

## Type composition

> **NOTE** This feature is currently not implemented.

Type entities can be defined in a form of composition of other Types. It gives you an ability to define common Type definitions once and reuse them later.

To enable Content Creator to compose Types in JSON schema, we use, among other things, [built-in JSON Schema combining functionality](http://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining.html). Every time we see a reference to external JSON schema, we fetch the type and embed its schema.

Once Content Creator submits a new Type and there is a reference to other Type, we create edges in the OCH for every single Type reference. It enables us to easily find Types, which are derived from original Types.

![Type composition](./assets/type-composition.svg)

This feature allows User to run generic Actions against different TypeInstances. For example, there could be an Action that takes IP Addresses as input. Thanks to the Type composition, User will be able to use the IP Addresses, which are nested in other TypeInstances.
