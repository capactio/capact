# Graph database investigations

The following directory contains different proof of concepts of using different graph databases for OCH.

There are the following proof of concept projects:
- [`neo4j-gogm`](./neo4j-gogm) - Evaluating Neo4j database with GoGM library 
- [`neo4j-graphql-js`](./neo4j-graphql-js) - Evaluating Neo4j database with `neo4j-graphql-js` library 
- [`dgraph`](./dgraph) - Using [Dgraph v20.07](https://dgraph.io/docs/v20.07/) database as backend and frontend for OCH
- [`grakn`](./grakn) - Using Grakn database in OCH with Go client generated from protobuf definitions.
