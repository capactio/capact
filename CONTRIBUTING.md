## Contribution process

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

### Report an issue

To report an issue, follow the steps:

1. Search [open and closed issues](https://github.com/Project-Voltron/voltron/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if your issue is not a duplicate. 
1. Navigate to [New issue](https://github.com/Project-Voltron/go-voltron/issues/new) page on the Capact GitHub repository.
1. Select an issue template, which is the most accurate for the issue type you report.
1. Describe the issue clearly according to the selected issue template.

### Create a pull request

To create a new pull request, follow the steps:

1. Make sure an issue related to the change [is reported](#report-an-issue).

## Support Channels

Currently, the only official way to get support is through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Project-Voltron/go-voltron/issues).
In the future, we will also create a dedicated Slack channel for making it easy to ask a question.
